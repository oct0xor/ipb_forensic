# IPB Forensic

MySql client for Invision Power Board. 

In 2015 there was a leak of nulled.io forum database and I wanted to do some investigation on it (mainly to check what malware users are sending to each other).

IPB forum software is not effective for analysis so I created my own viewer for database with ability to quickly browse forum topics and private messages.
